This is supposed to be a Turn-based strategy game based upon popular games like Final fantasy and Pokemon. The player attempts to fight an enemy, using attacks and magic to reduce the enemy's HP value to zero first. The player is supposed to use stragtey to win, as simply pressing the attack button over and over will result in a game over.
